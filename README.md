I had faced a situation where the client gave me a list of 2000 IP addresses list and after sometime client gave me another list of IP addresses which was not in scope. 
Now the problem was that I have to filter out the scope IP address from the IP address list. I had two options 1. Do it manually 2. Done by automation. I had chosen 2nd option.

Initially, automation takes time but it makes our life easy.

**Command:** Scope_IP_Address_Filter_From_IP_Address_List.exe IPaddresslist.txt outofscope.txt

Output is **Finalscope.txt**
